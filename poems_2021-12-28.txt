If he could enter this dark place of death,
the whole world will be his sincerest love.
His last breath would obliterate his breath
where all the bodies of his dead men shove.

Forgive not, and his body washes him.
Forgiving a mother where children die,
his last breath shall annihilate his grim
and grieve forlorn words in his body's cry.

He washes to the grave where him sons lie
withdrawing a mother where men beguile,
or who he mourns so long to see the cry.
Breathe back the last desire of his trial.

Within his last breath, he breathes liberty
soothe back the old pain of his company.

If they could bear this painless pain of death,
the painless pain will be their lightest life.
Within their heartless heart, they know the breath
breathe back the breathless prayer of their wife.

They know and love their possibility
and soothe their grief soothe when they see again.
But if they dole them to the somebody,
the other woman will be their worst pain.

Belief is the strength of ability
soothe not, and their love overpowers them.
For heaving fire with them pointedly,
heave back the flaming fire of their gem.

They know the strength of their own faithfulness.
Where all the things of their own lives progress.

         ---FOREST---       , k=2, b=5
The windy moon glazed him to serenade
within his dreamy dream, he saws the sun
assemble back the great tree of his shade.
Where all the grasses of his own fields run.

Forgive not, and his dream aspires him.
From thinnest branches, he sees heretofore
to be the world's king by the sea and swim
toss back the golden berry of his shore.

Of his home to meander waterfalls,
where the sun shines, himself anticipates
for the beauty, the evergreen recalls
whose sweet beauty it never contemplates.

But as the ocean should by night return,
shall heave his dream and see his homely fern.

The windy night weaned you to serenade
your beauty's sweet beauty so longed on so
beauty and beauty went within the shade
and now alluring to the lighted snow.

The windy night was in the company
those flowers that with auburn light gleamed pines,
which bloomed green overcomes to oversee?
Those grasses that with golden light shone vines.

Your heartless beauty would have died with you.
Which blossomed green aspires to befall?
How sweetly more pines toiled your way's bamboo.
You had an all new life and joyous hall.

Your life's aghast beauty so farmed on so
and soothed alluring woods in your way's snow.

The windy night weaned us to serenade
our beauty's sweet beauty so longed on so
we sought an all new life and ailing shade.
How sweetly more pines bloomed our beauty's snow.

Beauty and life aspired within the sky
our sun's light glen so farmed on evermore
so sheathing hissed where all our fair skies lie,
and wept soiled oaks in our way's sycamore.

Forlorn wept oaks, where once the wild birds sang
and robed oaks heard beauty in splattering.
Sore heaving wept where all our bright skies hang,
and felled oaks forage fern in colouring.

Nigh toiled police, where there the dead oaks lay
how sweetly more oaks blossomed our sun's gray.
