From thinnest branches, he sees everywhere
for surest things, he wonders waterfalls
from thinnest leaves, he wonders anywhere
whose soft beauty it evermore recalls.

Forlorn beauty, whose beauty he forgets?
For luring beauty with him evermore,
whose luscious life it evermore regrets.
Breathe back the long life of his sycamore.

So long a life of oaks, yet he knows there
in thawing, he knows to those that love oaks.
He knows, soothes the unsympathetic care
where all the flowers of his own pines coax.

Of his life to remember waterfalls,
whose fragrant life it oftentimes recalls.

         ---DEATH---       , k=2, b=7
A ghostly thing withstood in flames of fire,
my soul's last breath so longed on heretofore
not toiling toiled where all my light lives hire,
how sweetly more lives toiled my spirit's war.

So heaving hissed where all my bright eyes lay,
the life was in the end and the event
defeat and death beheld within the day
i had an all new life and new descent.

My spirit's last embrace so loved on there
and it rose life to the identity
the peace was in the dawn and the despair
and so proving to the dawned company.

The light forever was in the embrace
how ever more men breathed my spirit's face.


         ---DEATH---       , k=3, b=7
If you could enter this dark place of death,
the wayward soul will be your lightest life.
You have the power of your deathly breath.
Soothe back the weary spirit of your wife.

Nigh toils the earth that should have another,
and soothe your soul soothe when you come again.
Within your own soul, you have the mother
or who you love so dear to know the pain?

Upon you, your mother's identity
within your heartless heart, you know the pain
the childless child willed you to oversee
you live the life of your beloved brain.

So close a kiss of hands, yet you know not
and do nocturnal things in your heart's shot.
