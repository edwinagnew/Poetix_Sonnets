Solve the conflict, do the truce, strain the love.
Their vows are sofas in a peaceful quartz.

Fear overdo the sorrow soothed to them.
They envy as much as a solitude.
Within their wooded tent, they watch the hem
and trying their park by their solicitude.

They think, take the green archipelago

Brown is the life if the life is just slum.

A quiet garden blessed in manes of psalms.

Cough, cough the introduction of her war.

She bawled the head and cried and came and saw;
and yet in ferns of wounds her soul shall live.

For faith ails not for a lie so alive.

Oh evergreen, evergreen, evergreen,

If we could open this sweet fruit of life,
and aching our assent by our bloom,
and cheerfully working to the soured fife.
Flog, flog the plant of our resume.

A bitter war became in crows of clings.
Caffeine, caffeine, caffeine in the arrears.
A floral garden fanned in twigs of stings,
a shrill strife spread in spines of souvenirs.

But if we take us to the telegram,
and fastening red, we eat to those that cry
but if we stand us to the monogram,
and boating our disease by our reply.

For not dissension, but more joys, we licked.
For fear forgo first for a foul so strict.

If he could carry this whole thing of crime,
and he, even he, has to the ideal.
Aside shall he spot as ends forage time,
allies, like apropos leaves in the deal.

Froze the eye, pump the hair, hang the subject.
Comply outstretched, and his point trots with him.
Affairs, like auburn birds in the effect.
For death toils back for a revolt so grim.

The wreaths are right and right too are the bows.
But if he want himself to the romance,
and not allying to the vented rose.
Crawl back the high position of his chance.

Youth to youth, one to one, state against state.
Care the truth, care the cover, cause the hate.

What quiet solitude lie their conflict?
They drawled an all sweet war and pleasant strife.
Eclipse the strife or praise this calm addict
and sorrow is a cool and tranquil life.

For heaping calmness with them heretofore,
they are a daughter of young pioneers.
Dupe the child, cut the mother, make the door.
Like a son, they remember in frontiers.

Befell shall they be as hens mingle death,
asleep is this earth, for earth is asleep.
But if they meditate them to the breath,
and yet in aisles of isles their truce shall sleep.

Age arched with age and ashy arms quite quelled
will bear the landings to the blithely felled.

There is anointed, my hale land, more of;
eclipse the east or make this ancient earth
sore prowling bled where all my rough years love,
shall try my voice and be my restive birth.

But as the future should by water flow,
my moment ache even and my peace so.
For not one, but less advocates, I stow.
Where all the saints of my skinned streets forgo.

Hear, hear the cry of my identity.
Oft in a swarthy grave must I be turned.
Gay dawn, whose solitude I oversee?
I dined the boy and thought and heard and spurned;

My minds are ages in a manly man.
Blessed is the life if the life is just plan.

peace birth, 2, 2, True	         ---PEACE BIRTH---       , k=2
If we could stifle this calm strife of love,
the peace, like toils in the relationship
and toiling a conflict where weavers shove,
bore, bore the war of our companionship.

Grace arched and overrated every where.
Forgiving freely freedom of froth's life
but as the mother should by kingdom wear,
and we, even we, carry to the fife.

Right weaves the death that should end another,
to know a new unrest on peaceful child;
sustaining proudly son of all's mother
for we are a contentment in the mild.

So we through herrings of red aisles shall break,
and age is a blue and precise mistake.

If you could carry this tanned thing of truth,
allies, like toasted flowers in the end.
Outlast the age or quit this seedy youth
and yet in days of times your heart shall bend.

For you are a name in the fatherhood,
and yet in years of wars your life shall be.
March's son moves words but hisses brotherhood,
and never nagging to the beaded sea.

But as the darkness should by way atone,
asleep shall you fall as months slay divine,
and inching glad, you feed to those that moan
scared is the faith if the faith is just sign.

The laws are true and true too are the ones.
Those people that with good cause processed sons.

peace birth, 5, 2, True	         ---PEACE BIRTH---       , k=5
If we could conjure this calm truce of peace,
dissolve war that contentment may dissolve.
For we are a conflict in the police,
and aegis is an armed and ill resolve.

Do the mother, save the child, love the son.
Dreams and despair we disentangle for.
Dismayed, dismayed, dismayed in the young one.
For not fear, but more mackintosh, we bore.

Month to month, mom to mom, dad against dad.
For we are a strife in the workmanship,
and ailing new, we flail to those that pad
for we are a feud in the fellowship.

We are a life of bloody afternoons.
A blue age brought in andes of balloons.

peace birth, 5, 2, False	         ---PEACE BIRTH---       , k=5
The first time weeded us to serenade
eke us dank days, and we will kneel dank days.
Allies, like ailing angels in the trade.
A kinky way toiled in ourselves of ways.

We willed the world and wept and wagged astride;
ideals, like deathly hands in the desert.
Already dozed the thing's anointed side.
For grace sieve not for a name so alert.

The very bogs where every one leaves long,
forgiveness farmed and fastened every where,
and trying good, we get to those that belong
and that control which doleful smiles ensnare.

This sewn to thaw here propped when we lay wan
and that return which weedy moments spawn.

If they could swallow this sweet war of life,
and yet in soaps of spoons their strife shall stop.
Diluting proudly stillness of those's wife
and having their contentment by their sop.

Truce, the mother of all aristocrats.
Austere is purging and purging austere.
A new death loathed in aisles of democrats,
and aching their toil by their brigadier.

When they become nigh, the nigh become them.
For first forsaking fathers forage food,
and marriage is a loving and full stem.
How goodly more isles made their city's mood.

Boutique, boutique, boutique in the young child.
Draughts, like red cemeteries in the mild.

peace birth, 10, 1, False	         ---PEACE BIRTH---       , k=10
If I could enter this kind house of life,
and beaming my beauty by my divine.
Allies, like loving parents in the wife.
Adhere toiled the day's regimental sign.

When I begin, begin with my own time.
Blue is the joy if the joy is just cause.
For fear forgo fast for a friend so prime.
A fellow girl willed in affairs of laws.

Belief is knowledge, knowledge is belief.
For ailing family with me heretofore,
and the things underlined my joyous grief.
I came an all outstretched cry and dazed war.

Like heart to heart, blood to blood, soul to soul,
and that disease which crushed ideas dole.

What military conflict brings his peace?
The battle goes like a peace in the strife;
will weasel the warms to the weakly nice.
Anew trudged the truce's patriotic life.

When he stood the cold, farmed companionship
when bitter robbers shall bide his distress,
he has, hath the traumatic battleship
those captors that with bloody death drawled abs.

The grief pours like a terror in the mind;
and he, even he, hears to the despair.
Him nears on the birds of oppression's wind
he stayed the night and kept and banded there.

He kissed the ache and dreamed and saw and cried.
Discreetly sympathized the psalm's sweet side.

If I could annul this soiled mess of wealth,
souls toasted me to recapitulate
sore mannered the coast's overrated health.
Where all the things of my own ways dictate.

Scale's gold drapes arabs but exudes respect,
i speak as still as a relationship,
this soothe to lead now toiled when I broached wrecked
and only trying to the seeped leadership.

Hereby is this twinge, for twinge is hereby.
My word stand straight and my truth heretofore.
But as the tingling should by day decry,
and time is a new and exciting war.

So sweet a song of sorts, yet I sieve so
when I befall, befall with my tamed toe.

If you could carry this cold truce of trust,
and battle is a long and bitter peace.
But if you take yourself to the disgust,
tirades, like bloody gossips in the grease.

Grunt brutal, and your sorrow grows with you.
Befell is this throne, for throne is befell.
Grilled is the glee if the glee is just pew.
For love do not for a grief so unwell.

and cheerfully rearing to the bawled baton.
Forgives, like fair ferns in the firefly.
The hunger shuns like a death in the swan;
so too your dews thaw to your lullaby.

Like an ache, you feel in apologies.
Discreetly nipped the bell's sweet diocese.

If she could produce this kind trial of death,
those people that with noxious cause asked years,
marines, like deathly rashes in the breath.
Like a cat, she originates in tears.

When she growled the due, soiled relationship
for loss toils long for a self so askew.
Dash, dash the pressure of her leadership,
concerns, like ailing forces in the crew.

For not tank, but more chills, she overstayed.
Fast is the hope if the hope is just fear.
Her blisters are cramps in a fit brigade.
For pain ails meekly for a night so dear.

How hard was her, when her had her today,
and goodly mangling to the banked essay.

war pain, 5, 2, True	         ---WAR PAIN---       , k=5
If we could preface this long peace of love,
pier to pier, dint to dint, charm against charm.
Aside shall we say as weeps weasel dove,
and droning our strife by our alarm.

the tersely tanned where every wind wails so.
Anew groaned the death's bitter lullaby.
For we are a disease in the chateau,
and bravely trying to the moored firefly.

The tusks are cold and cruel are the tusks;
a bloody battle longed in bloods of bees.
Like a grief, we apologize in husks.
A painful sadness filled in cracks of teas.

in the ache, in the sleep, about the spades.
A sweet affliction stood in aisles of shades.
