         ---WISDOM---       , k=4, b=5
If I could enter this vast world of love,
so too my people will know to my heart.
But as the spirit should by passion shove,
i have the power of my heartless art.

I have to the heart to make everything
i love the world of my own faithfulness.
I have to the mind to see anything
where all the things of my own joys progress.

So long a life of joys, yet I have not;
so longs the soul that should love another,
lose back the joyous passion of my lot.
I know the way of my beloved mother.

Forgive not, and my love abandons me.
Assemble back the old love of my tree.
