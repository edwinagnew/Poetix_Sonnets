         ---LOVE---       , k=2, b=7
If he could enter this new world of love,
so too his friends will know to his delight;
so heaving hissed where all his wan arms shove,
how sweetly more joys heaped his spirit's light.

Twice heaving soothed where all his gilt wings fling,
how slowly more joys filled his heart's delight.
The thought was in the mind and the spring
and heaped alluring joys in his heart's sight.

Those beauties that with loving love had joys,
and it seemed joy to the companionship
but he knew to his unrepentant boys
and toiled his life by his relationship.

His life's aghast delight so heaped on so
and soothed forlorn words in his prayer's glow.
