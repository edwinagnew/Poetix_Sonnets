(45)	Shall be his voice and be his heartless choice.

(19)	Forlorn toiled men, where there the dead men lay
(21)	The dead man unencumbered them to groan

(19)	Eighth yearned delights, where now the dead men stood
(22)	And sang their part by their companionship,

(16)	Beauty and beauty toiled within the gem
(2)	And toiled forlorn hearts in their beauty's fall.

(20)	The gem they loved, the gem, the world, the song.

(13)	If they could listen this long time of life,
(-1)	So too their children will hear to their grief;
(-1)	Or who they love so dear to be the wife?

(83)	The joys of life, the beauty on the face,
(-1)	They know, love the unmitigated glow
(11)	Where all the joys of their own lives embrace. 

(-1)	They know, they know, they underestimate
(84)	When all the wonders of this world are past,
(4)	Forgetting a life where joys abdicate,
(82)	Between the darkening and the brightening blast. 

(-1)	So long a life of joys, yet they know not;
(14)	And faring their desire by their lot.

(21)	The windy day withstood me to befall
(5)	How sweetly more joys heaped my heart's delight. 
(-1)	Which soothed one overshadows to recall?
(5)	How often more joys toiled my spirit's light. 

(17)	The windy day was in the solitude
(22)	And soothed my heart by my ability. 
(17)	The grassy path was in the fortitude
(22)	And toiled my soul by my adversity. 

(6)	My heartless heart would have rejoiced with me. 
(16)	Beauty and beauty had within the heart
(1)	And so alluring to the hearted tree. 
(20)	The heart i loved, the heart, the tree, the art. 

(21)	The heartless tree loved me to persecute
(2)	And soothed meek hearts in my quest's absolute.

(31)	So long a life of things, yet she has not;
(84)	When all the grasses of this world are dead,
(9)	To live the life's life by the grass and trot
(11)	Where all the flowers of her fair skies spread. 

(-1)	Why do she waltzes such a long retreat?
(26)	Forlorn beauty, whose life she contemplates?
(3)	Her deathly beauty must befall her street
(-1)	Whose rich beauty it never hesitates.

(45)	Shall weasel her life and live her fair hall.
