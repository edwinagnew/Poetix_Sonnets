(85)	When all the powers of this world are fair,
(61)	Beauty is the beauty of faithfulness
(95)	In love she does not seek it with her care
(11)	Where all the gifts of her own eyes address. 

(71)	The beauty of love on a holy day
(87)	For all the joy that does befall herself,
(38)	And thus allude to the unvarnished way. 
(20)	She knows the beauty of her heartless self. 

(99)	So does the love that should be another,
(2)	But as the beauty should by nature be,
(104)	The beauty, like ourselves in the mother
(83)	Between the waking and the sleeping tree. 

(90)	These are the powers that she take care of. 
(20)	She has the power of her selfless love. 


         ---FOREST---       , k=5, b=5, rep=1.6
(85)	When all the flowers of this world are dead,
(119)	Within my heartless world, i have the light
(9)	To make the world's light by the light and lead
(38)	And singly sing to the unvarnished night. 

(125)	So long a way of things, yet i have not;
(130)	I have to the world where my pastures lie
(137)	I know, i underestimate, i trot
(118)	And trot my way outlast when i have nigh. 

(137)	I know, i have, i underestimate
(113)	I trot, trot the undying avenue
(11)	Where all the things of my past lives dictate. 
(82)	Me cannot measure. Cannot rendezvous. 

(2)	But as the garden should by night renew,
(139)	So too my paths will be to my bamboo;


         ---LOVE---       , k=7, b=7, rep=1.2
(75)	An auburn berry from the groundless sea
(66)	He pours and sponges to those that have not
(9)	To see the sun's rise by the sea and see
(83)	Between the rising and the falling lot. 

(85)	When all the beauties of this world are dead,
(95)	In death he does not see them with his face
(11)	Where all the flowers of his own joys spread. 
(20)	He sees the sun of his eternal place. 

(64)	He sees to the end to see everything
(83)	Between the living and the deadening light. 
(19)	He sees, aspires the dead anything
(20)	He loves the living of his own delight. 

(84)	The joys of life, the beauty on the earth,
(46)	Shall be his life and be his joyous birth. 


         ---WISDOM---       , k=3, b=5, rep=1.6
(22)	When all the powers of this world are fair,
(16)	Beauty and beauty toiled within the heart
(1)	And thus alluring to the hearted prayer. 
(20)	The heart we dozed, the mind, the soul, the art. 

(17)	The heartless spirit was in the embrace
(6)	Our heartless spirit would have loved with us. 
(28)	Which wept forever forage to displace?
(5)	How sweetly more joys toiled our life's success. 

(28)	Which toiled life forage to exasperate?
(16)	Despair and grief withstood within the mind
(27)	Which made love toils to underestimate?
(23)	So we through joys of joyous joys entwined. 

(3)	Our life's triumphal life so longed on so
(23)	So we through struggles of fierce struggles stow. 


         ---FOREST---       , k=7, b=7, rep=1.8
(85)	When all the flowers of this world are dead,
(9)	To go the way's path by the way and see
(11)	Where all the grasses of her past lives lead. 
(83)	Between the living and the deadening sea. 

(68)	She has to the shore where her pastures lie
(84)	The grasses of life, the grass on the shore,
(38)	And there avenge to the unvarnished sky. 
(99)	So too her pastures will befall her store. 

(91)	Why do she waltzes such a wayward way?
(75)	An old man from the faraway desert
(104)	But if she overcomes her to the bay,
(82)	She cannot disentangle. Cannot hurt. 

(90)	These are the grasses that she take care of. 
(82)	She cannot reminiscence. Cannot love. 


         ---WISDOM---       , k=7, b=5, rep=1.2
(85)	When all the powers of this world are fair,
(112)	I know and wonder to those that know not
(113)	Within my own heart, i believe despair
(83)	Between the darkening and the brightening lot. 

(86)	Why do i wonder such a manly man?
(84)	The things of life, the beauty on the earth,
(9)	To see the world's light by the light and scan
(11)	Where all the things of my own joys unearth. 

(134)	I wonder to the world where my joys lie
(137)	I wonder, i know, i anticipate
(127)	Within my own mind, i foresee the eye
(111)	Whose light divine it never deviate. 

(8)	Forbid the world or let this manly man
(82)	Me cannot disentangle. Cannot ban.
