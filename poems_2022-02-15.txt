(13)	If she could forage this new world of love,
(-1)	so too her children will live to her death;
(9)	to be the one's child by the hand and shove
(-1)	and singling her forever by her breath.

(-1)	So longs the love that should be another,
(10)	and soothe aghast hearts in her heart's embrace.
(8)	Forgive the man or let this poor mother
(19)	she has the heart of her loquacious face.

(11)	Where all the joys of her past lives revolve.
(26)	Forgetful love, whose life she contemplates?
(4)	Forgiving a man where mistakes devolve,
(-1)	whose heartless life it never hesitates.

(69)	A man without love and companionship
(38)	and not love to the hurt relationship.
