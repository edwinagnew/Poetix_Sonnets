         ---LOVE---       , k=3, b=7
(13)	If we could enter this new world of love,
(-1)	the old world will be our lightest hope.
(11)	Where all the beauties of our past lives shove.
(82)	We cannot reminiscence. cannot mope.

(31)	The whole world willed us to exasperate
(9)	to see the sun's face by the sea and see
(-1)	where the sea loll, we underestimate
(83)	between the rising and the falling sea.

(31)	The skyward sky weaned us to understand
(-1)	or who we have so long to see the sun.
(22)	Weigh back the great beauty of our land.
(82)	We cannot disentangle. cannot shun.

(27)	Upon ourselves, our life's companionship
(38)	and close love to the dawned relationship.
